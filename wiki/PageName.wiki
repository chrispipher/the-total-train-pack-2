==Other Goodies==
Compatibility with RD2 to allow linking resources to SENT cars.
----
Modified LS2 addon with corrected resource names and space related devices removed.
----
Illumination Addon - Recoded working lamps that use either 12v Energy or Energy. Comes in several colors also.

==Fossil Fuel Systems Addon==
Recoded version of petrol mod with cleaner code and new devices. Adds oil based resources which are used by the train car SENTS:
Diesel, Crude Oil, 12v Energy, Oil, Gasoline, Bio Diesel, co2 (Carbon Dioxide), Methanol, and more.
(Future versions will eliminate the antlion thumpers as an oil drill and replace it with an actual animated pump jack that only animates and pumps when placed on an oil deposit area. Still a little ways off though right now.)
----
==Water Systems==
Based off the water works addon but with fixed SENT spawning and cleaner code. 
Adds: resources, collection, storage and devices.
Water, Steam, Super Heated Steam, Ionized Water
----

ENDV Mining Mod - A modified version of our space mining mod for spacebuild 2 and RD/LS2 for land mining of resources such as coal and other ores from mining nodes throughout the Tr_railroads game map. (Not available yet due to mapping the mining nodes auto spawns)
----
==Future Planned additions (WIP)==
*Military related train cars* (From WW2 German weapons cars to modern army and air force cars)
----
*MOW car sets* (cranes, crew cars, track X-Ray units, grinders, ballast spreaders, etc)
----
*Scripted passenger cars* (allow players to actually sit in a passenger car)
----
*Scripted Locomotives* (Spawns assembled and requires resources to run, holds diesel, steam, water, air and energy in on board storage depending on type of locomotive but requires you fill the tanks first. Also will have cabview, sounds, and lighting scripted in too. Air is auto filled via on board air compressors)
----
*Train Assembly STOOL* (To make putting train parts on easier)
----
*Wiremod friendly animated railroad crossing signals and gates*
Spawn the SENT and wire to the sensor of your choosing in wiremod.
Future maps hopefully will have wiring nodes for this type of feature.
----
*Steam Locomotive coal tenders* to hold Coal and Water resources
----
*Dynamic train braking modules* (Attach to each train car and wire via wiremod to give your train actual brakes, uses air resource. Should be wired to an e2 or number pad or other control device or even a radio link to the locomotive unit and to buttons or analog levers.)
----
*MU Modules* - Have multiple locomotives working in sync and controlled by the master unit like a real train. Good for slave or B units.
----
*Personal Conductor* - have your own conductor bot in the cab. change turnouts, see track signals on a display, couple and uncouple cars.
----
*Dynamic Couplers* - working similar to the wiremod plug and sockets but alot stronger and allows ball socket type pivoting, auto couple when two are armed and touch eachother and uncouples via wire control or personal conductor commands. Will transfer air resource for dynamic train braking system
